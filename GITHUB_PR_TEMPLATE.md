# feat: Phase 2 Part 2 - Integrate skeleton loaders into ProductPage, SearchPage, and CartSummary

## 🎯 Description

This PR implements skeleton loading states for three key pages of the e-commerce application to improve user experience during data loading. 

**What's included:**
- ProductPage (SimpleProducts.tsx) - Product grid skeleton loader
- SearchPage (SearchResults.tsx) - Search results with filter skeleton
- CartSummary (CartSummary.tsx) - Optional loading state for cart calculations

All integrations use the new `useLoadingState` hook with:
- Automatic retry logic on failure
- 8-second timeout protection  
- User-friendly error states
- Zero layout shift (CLS prevention)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant accessibility
