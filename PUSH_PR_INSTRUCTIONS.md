## 🧪 Before Pushing: Quick Verification

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check TypeScript (will have errors - expected!)
npx tsc --noEmit
# Should show ~50-100 errors from strict mode
# This is GOOD - they're type safety issues to fix later

# 2. Check ESLint
npm run lint
# Should show ~20-30 warnings (unused vars)
# These are also expected

# 3. Try building
npm run build
# Should complete successfully despite TS errors
# (Vite still compiles with warnings)

# 4. Run dev server (quick check)
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:8080
# Check browser console for logger output:
# [2025-10-08...] [DEBUG] Performance optimizations applied
# [2025-10-08...] [DEBUG] Web Vitals monitoring initialized
# [2025-10-08...] [INFO] Service Worker registered successfully...
```

## 📝 PR Checklist

Before submitting:

- [x] Branch created: `feat/phase1-code-quality-improvements`
- [x] All files committed
- [x] PR description ready (`PR_PHASE1_CODE_QUALITY.md`)
- [ ] Branch pushed to GitHub
- [ ] PR created on GitHub
- [ ] Reviewers assigned
- [ ] CI/CD passes (wait after PR creation)
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] PR merged

---

## 🔍 Expected CI/CD Results

After pushing, GitHub Actions will run:

### ✅ Should Pass:
- **Build:** Compiles successfully (Vite ignores TS errors in build)
- **Unit Tests:** All existing tests pass
- **E2E Tests:** Smoke tests pass (no breaking changes)

### ⚠️ May Fail (Expected):
- **TypeScript Check:** May show errors due to strict mode
  - This is intentional - fix in follow-up PRs
- **ESLint:** May show warnings for unused vars
  - Also intentional - clean up in follow-up PRs

### 🛠️ If CI Fails:
```bash
# Run locally to debug
npm run test
npm run test:e2e:smoke
npm run build

# Check specific errors
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty
```
